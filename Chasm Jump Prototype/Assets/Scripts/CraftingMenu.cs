// PLayer selects buttons from tools, raw resources, crafting items, and components.
// Button of selection is outlined to indicate the item is selected
// Item is added to currently crafting
// Item name is added to the text box above the results outline so the player can see all
// items that are selected.
// If the combination of selections makes an item, the item icon will appear in the results
// outline as a  button. If the player presses the button, they will gain that item
// and their inventory will be updated (item additions and subtractions)
